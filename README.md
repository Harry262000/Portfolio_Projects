# Electricity Usage and Demand Forecasting

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a time series forecasting project focused on predicting electricity usage and demand. The goal of this project is to develop accurate models that can forecast future electricity consumption patterns, helping utilities and energy providers better manage their resources and plan for future demand.

## Features

- Implements various time series forecasting algorithms.
- Supports both univariate and multivariate forecasting approaches.
- Provides pre-processing utilities for cleaning and transforming electricity usage data.
- Easily customizable for different geographical regions and electricity consumption patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/electricity-forecasting.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd electricity-forecasting
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Prepare your electricity usage data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
2. Run the appropriate forecasting script:

    ```bash
    python forecast.py --input_file usage_data.csv
    ```

### Customization

- For advanced usage and customization, refer to the documentation in `docs/`.

## Examples

- Check out the `examples/` directory for sample electricity usage datasets and expected output.
