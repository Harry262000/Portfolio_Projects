# Electricity Usage and Demand Forecasting

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a time series forecasting project focused on predicting electricity usage and demand. The goal of this project is to develop accurate models that can forecast future electricity consumption patterns, helping utilities and energy providers better manage their resources and plan for future demand.

## Features

- Implements various time series forecasting algorithms.
- Supports both univariate and multivariate forecasting approaches.
- Provides pre-processing utilities for cleaning and transforming electricity usage data.
- Easily customizable for different geographical regions and electricity consumption patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
